2. all metadata of provider server is stored in the mysql database that providing better data security.
3. providers do not need to pay attention for the details of the deal,  only need to query the market regularly to see if you have any deal to seal. 
4. market maintain a piece pool, that is, to provide the provider with the data for sealing deals, and it can also speed up the retrieval speed. ask miners for unseal operations, only when missing piece in venus-market.
